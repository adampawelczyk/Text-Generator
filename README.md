## General info
Machine learning is getting crazy smart these days. You've probably read texts or scripts written by machine learning algorithms, some of them even mimicking styles of certain people! In this project I'll create a simple text generator using Markov chains. Text-Generator will use a corpus that contains the entire script of Game of Thrones. The corpus will be used to "train" a probabilistic model that will predict the next word in a chain of words, the generated text will resemble the style and vocabulary of the source material.

## Technologies
* python - version 3.8
* nltk - version 3.5

## Code Examples

corpus.txt
I risked everything to me before the crops turn.
Women scream when my father came to hear it Without Sansa,
We won't become friends today.
Davos Will you stay on with it.
What I'm trying and failing to protect her.
This belongs to you as well.
Sept eats away the bride.
Worst place in your flames,
Starks come to conquer the world to me.
Watch with me! Knock! Knock! Draw! Loose! They won't get one without the dogs or climb a cliff.

Myrcella marries the Martell boy,
To serve my queen and have a look.
SNOW takes the Iron Islands,
A young man I know.
I went back to me.
Perhaps she's tired of hacking at me,
I throw them in their iron suits and tear down their spears and surrendered.
Sansa Winterfell is burned to death.
A girl at Casterly Rock.
God is the Mother to bless our crops so we don't stand a chance against the gates and my father both.

Salladhor Saan is a wine merchant's best friend.
Oberyn died fighting for him.
The soldiers you order into battle.
House Frey! We stand together! May we have and station them outside the bonds of marriage,
Bronn of the Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin as we get married,
One hand is all he's ever done.
Lord cast your light upon this man,
Throne but no man will do nic- ah! On the morning of my blood.
Hobb makes venison stew with onions.
